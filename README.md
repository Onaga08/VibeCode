# 🎧 VibeCode

Welcome to the chillest way to write code inside VS Code.

VibeCode is your personal aesthetic enhancer. Every keystroke triggers a wave of ✨ animations, bold color pops, and old-school **typewriter sounds** — because who says coding can’t be dramatic?

---

## 🚀 Features

- 💥 **Boom! Pow! Typing animations**  
  Each keystroke spawns a funky floating character. It bounces, spins, and vanishes like a mic drop.

- 🔊 **Typewriter Sound FX**  
  Miss the sound of actual keys clacking? We gotchu. VibeCode plays a classic typewriter "click" every time you type.

- 🎯 **Cursor target marker**  
  A bold visual marker that follows your cursor around like a laser sight in a spy movie. Optional, of course.

- 🎨 **Keyword Highlights**  
  When you type a keyword like `function` or `await`, it pops with bold color and style. Instant dopamine hit.

## 🔧 Extension Settings

VibeCode comes with a few toggles you can control in your VS Code settings:

```json
"vibecode.on": true // Turn the extension on/off
```

## 📸 Example

Here’s a preview of what it looks like when you’re vibin' and codin':
